    \question{
        [1-29]If $A$ is compact, prove that every
        continuous
        function $f:A\to\mathbf{R}$ takes on a maximum
        and a minimum value.
    }

    \begin{solution}
        
        \begin{proof}
            Since $A$ is compact and $f$ is continuous, we
            know that the image of $A$ under $f$ is compact
            in $\mathbf{R}$. Hence, it follows from 3.1,
            that $f$ takes on a maximum and a minimum value.
        \end{proof}

        \begin{lemma}
            A compact set in $\mathbf{R}$ has a maximum
            and a minimum value.
            \begin{proof}
                We know that a compact set is closed and
                bounded and in $\mathbf{R}$, a compact set
                is in the form $[a,b]$. And since $a, b \in
                [a,b]$, all we need to show is that $a$ and
                $b$ are infimum and supremum, respectively,
                of the given interval.
            \end{proof}
