\question{
    [3-12]
    Let $f:[a, b]\to\rl$ be an increasing
    function. Show that $\{x:\textnormal
    {$f$ is discontinuous at $x$}\}$ has
    measure 0.
    
    Hint: Use Problem 1-30 to
    show that $\{x:o(f,x)>1/n\}$ is
    finite, for each integer n.

\begin{solution}
    Let $B=\{x:\textnormal
    {$f$ is discontinuous at $x$}\}$. Then
    we know that
    $$\sum_{x\in B}{o(f,x)}<f(b)-f(a).$$
    Let $A_n$ be the set $\{x:o(f,x)>1/n\}$
    for each $n$.
    Then for an increasing function
    $$f(b)-f(a)>\sum_{x\in A_n}{o(f,x)}
    >\sum_{x\in A}{\dfrac{1}{n}}.$$
    However, since $f(b)-f(a)$ is finite
    ($f([a,b])$ is bounded and
    closed),
    there should be finitely many
    $x\in A_n$ for each $n$.
