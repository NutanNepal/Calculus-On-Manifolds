\question{
    [3-8]
    Prove that $[a_1,b_1]\times\cdots\times
    [a_n,b_n]$ does not have content $0$ if
    $a_i\le b_i$ for each $i$.
}
\begin{solution}
    The given rectangle is compact in $\ron$.
    Let $\{U_1,\ldots,U_m\}$ be the finite
    cover of $[a_1,b_1]\times\cdots\times
    [a_n,b_n]$ by closed rectangles where we
    assume that each $U_j\subset 
    [a_1,b_1]\times\cdots\times [a_n,b_n]$.
    And let $P_i$ be the sequence $t_{i,0},
    t_{i,1},\ldots,t_{i,k}$ where $a_i=
    t_{i,0}<t_{i,1}<\ldots<t_{i,k}=b_i$.
    Then the partition $P=(P_1,\ldots,P_n)$
    divides the rectangle into $k^n$
    subrectangles. If we let $a_i=
    t_{i,0}<t_{i,1}<\ldots<t_{i,k}=b_i$
    be all the
    corners of all $U_j$, then each $U_j$ is
    the union of finite subrectangles in $P$.
    And hence, each $v(U_j)
    $ is the sum of volume of certain
    subrectangles of the partition.
    Also since each subrectangle lies in at
    least one $U_j$,
    \begin{align*}
        &\textnormal{sum
    of volume of all the closed covers
    $U_i$}\\
    \ge&\textnormal{sum of volumes of each
    subrectangles}\\
    =&v([a_1,b_1]\times\cdots\times
    [a_n,b_n])
    \end{align*}
