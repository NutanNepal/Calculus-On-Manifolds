\question{
    Let $A\subset\ron$ be an open set
    and $f:A\to\ron$ a continuously
    differentiable 1-1 function such
    that $\det{f'(x)}\ne 0$ for all
    $x$. Show that $f(A)$ is an open
    set and $f^{-1}(A):f(A)\to A$ is
    differentiable. Show also that
    $f(B)$ is open for any open set
    in $A$.
