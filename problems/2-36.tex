    [2-36]
    Let $A\subset\ron$ be an open set
    and $f:A\to\ron$ a continuously
    differentiable 1-1 function such
    that $\det{f'(x)}\ne 0$ for all
    $x$. Show that $f(A)$ is an open
    set and $f^{-1}:f(A)\to A$ is
    differentiable. Show also that
    $f(B)$ is open for any open set
    in $A$.

\begin{solution}
    The inverse function theorem:
    Suppose $f:\ron\to\ron$ is a continuously
    differentiable in an open set containing
    $a$, and $\det{f'(a)}\ne 0$. Then there
    is an open set $V$ containing $a$ and an
    open set $W$ containing $f(a)$ such that
    $f:V\to W$ has a continuous inverse $f^{-1}
    :W\to V$ which is differentiable.

    Then since $f:A\to\ron$ is continuously
    differentiable in the open set $A$ with
    $\det{f'(x)}\ne 0$ for all $x\in A$ there
    exists open sets $V_x \subset A$ for
    every $x\in A$ with $W_x \subset \ron$
    such that each $f:
    V_x\to W_x$ has continuous and differentiable
    inverse $f^{-1}:
    W_x\to V_x$. We note that $A\subset
    \bigcup_{x\in A}{V_x}$ and since each $V_x
    \subset A$, we have $A=\bigcup_{x\in A}{V_x}$.
    Also since $f$ is 1-1 and
    invertible on each $W_x$, $f(V_x)=W_x$.
    Hence,
    $$f(A)= f\left(\bigcup_{x\in A}
        {V_x}\right)=\bigcup_{x\in A}{W_x}$$
    which is open. Similarly
    $$f^{-1}(W_x)=V_x=A.$$
    And since $f^{-1}$ is continuous,
    every open subset $B$ of $A$ has an open
    subset $f(B)\subset f(A)$.
