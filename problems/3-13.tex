    (a) Show that the collection of
    all rectangles $[a_1,b_1]\times
    \ldots\times[a_n,b_n]$ with all
    $a_i$ and $b_i$ rational can be
    arranged in a sequence.

    (b) If $A\subset\ron$ is any set
    and $\mathscr{O}$ is an open cover
    of $A$, show that there is a
    sequence $U_1,U_2,U_3,\ldots$ of
    members of $\mathscr{O}$ which also
    cover $A$. 
    
    Hint: For each $x\in A$ there is a
    rectangle $B = [a_1,b_1]\times\ldots
    \times[a_n,b_n]$ with all $a_i$ and
    $b_i$ rational such that $x\in B
    \subset U$ for some $U\in\mathscr{)}.

    (a) We will prove this by induction.
    For base case, we will show that
    $[a_1,b_1]\times[a_2,b_2]$ is
    countable if each $a_i$ and $b_i$
    are rational.

    We know that rational numbers are
    countable. Let the rational numbers
    between $a_1$ and $b_1$ be arranged
    in the sequence $a_{1,1},a_{1,2},
    a_{1,3}\ldots$. Then let each
    intervals $[a_{1,i},a_{1,i+1}]
    \subset[a_1,b_1]$ be denoted $V_i$.
    We do the same for $[a_2,b_2]$ to
    get the sequence of countable
    intervals $W_j$. Now let $U_{i,j}$
    denote $V_i\times W_j$ for each $V_i$
    and $W_j$. It is clear that each
    corners of $U_{i,j}$ have rational
    coordinates. Then we can see that
    \begin{center}
    \countable
    \end{center}
    all the $U_{i,j}$ can be arranged
    in a sequence.

    Now, assuming that we can do the same
    for $[a_1,b_1]\times\ldots
    \times[a_n,b_n]$, we get a sequence
    of closed rectangles $V_i\subset
    \ron$ with each $a_i$ and $b_i$
    rational. We can also get the
    sequence of intervals $W_j$
