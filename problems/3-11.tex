    Let A be the set of Problem 1-18.
    If $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}{(b_i-a_i)}
    <1$, show that the boundary of $A$
    does not have measure 0.

    [1-18]
    If $A\subset[0,1]$ is the union of
    open intervals $(a_i,b_i)$ such
    that each rational number in $[0,1]$
    is contained in some $(a_i,b_i)$,
    show that boundary $A = [0,1] - A.$
}
\begin{solution}
    Since each $(a_i,b_i)$ contains a
    rational number, the collection 
    $\mathscr{O}$ of
    $(a_i, b_i)$ is countable. Now,
    assume that
    the boundary of $A$ doesnt not have
    measure zero. Then there exists a
    countable cover of the boundary by
    closed rectangles $U_i$ such that
    $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}{v(U_i)}<
    \varepsilon$ for every $\varepsilon
    >0$ Then there is a
    countable collection of closed
    rectangles $V_j$ that cover all of
    $[0,1]$ such that $\sum_{j=1}^
    {\infty}{v(V_j)}<1.$ But, we know
    that $\sum_{j=1}^
    {\infty}{v(V_j)}$ should be at least
    $1-0=1$. Hence, we have a
    contradiction.
