\question{
    Let $f:A\to\rl$ be integrable and let
    $g=f$ except at finitely many points. Show
    that $g$ is integrable and $\int_A{f}
    =\int_A{g}.$
}
\begin{solution}
    Let $P$ be a partition of $A$ such that
    the function $f$ differs from $g$ at
    finitely many points contained in the closed
    subrectangles $S_1, S_2,..., S_n$ where each
    subrectangle has a side $\varepsilon>0$.Then
    \begin{align*}
        &\left(U(f, P)-L(f,P)\right)-\left(U(g,P)-
    L(g,P)\right)\\
    =&\sum_{k=1}^n{\left(M_f(S_k)-m_f(S_k)\right)
    \cdot v(S_k)}-\sum_{k=1}^n{\left(M_g(S_k)
    -m_g(S_k)\right)
    \cdot v(S_k)}
    \end{align*}
    since the $f$ and $g$ only differ in $S_i$.
    Also, the volume of each $S_i$ is given by
    some $\varepsilon'>0$. Since $\varepsilon'$
    is arbitrary, we see that
    \begin{align*}
        &\left(U(f, P)-L(f,P)\right)-
    \left(U(g,P)-L(g,P)\right)<p\varepsilon'\\
    \textnormal{or, }&\int_A{f}-\left(U(g,P)-
    L(g,P)\right)<p\varepsilon'
    \end{align*}
    for some $p\in\rl$. Also since $f$ is
    integrable, $\left(U(g,P)-
    L(g,P)\right)<\varepsilon'\cdot
    \varepsilon''$ for
    another arbitrary $\varepsilon''>0$.
