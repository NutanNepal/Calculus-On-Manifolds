    [1-25] Define $f:\rl\to\rl$ by
    $$f(x)=
    \begin{dcases}
        e^{-x^{-2}}&x\neq 0,\\
        0&x=0.
    \end{dcases}$$
    Show that $f$ is a $C^{\infty}$
    function and $f^{(i)}(0)=0$ for
    all $i$.
}
\begin{solution}
    We know that,
    $$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}{
        \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
    }$$
    exists and equals $\dfrac{2}{x^3}
    e^{x^{-2}}$ when $x\ne 0$. The
    first derivative is given by
    $$f'(x)=\dfrac{2}{x^3}f(x).$$
    The subsequent derivatives $f^n(x)
    $ can be then found by the
    quotient rule, which guarantees
    that there won't be more zeroes
    in the denominator
    of the derivatives except $x=0$.
    Hence if the first
    derivative is continuous at $x=0$,
    the derivatives of all order exist.
    Now, we'll prove the existence
    of derivative at $x=0$. 
    So when $x=0$,
    $$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}{\frac{
        f(h)-f(0)
    }{h}}=
    \lim_{h\to 0}{
        \frac{1/h}{e^{h^{-2}}}}.$$
    Then by L'Hospital rule we have,
    $$f'(0)=\lim_{h\to 0}{\frac{
        -1/h^2
    }{(2/h^3)f(h)}}=
    \lim_{h\to 0}{\frac{-h}{2f(h)}}
    =0.$$
    The derivative clearly exists at
    $x=0$. To show the continuity, we
    observe that,
    $$\lim_{x\to 0}{f'(x)}=
    \lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{2}{x^3}e^{-x^
    {-2}}}=0=f'(0)$$
    follows from the L'Hospital rule.
