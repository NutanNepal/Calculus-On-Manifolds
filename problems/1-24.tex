\question{
    [1-24] Prove that $f:A\to \rom$ is continuous
    if and only if each $f_i$ is.
}

\begin{solution}
    If $f:A \to \rom$ is continuous then for
    all $a\in A$, $\lim_{x\to a}{f(x)}=f(a)$.
    But this means that for all $a\in A$,
    $lim_{x\to a}{f_i(x)} =f_i(a)$. Hence,
    each $f_i(x)$ is continuous.

    Similarly, converse follows from [1-23].
