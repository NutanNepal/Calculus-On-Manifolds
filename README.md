#Calculus on Manifolds

Book: Calculus on Manifolds, A modern approach to classical
theorems
Author: Michael Spivak

These are notes written during Spring 2019 when I was
doing independent study from Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds
book. Most of the contents are answers to the
exercises from the book. I've also
included some definitions, (mostly from Munkres' Analysis
on Manifolds book) theorems and proofs for my own understanding. I plan to include supplementary notes that
I think are essential for the understanding of the
materials.

##Remarks

This is still in progress and won't be completed before
summer 2019.
