\begin{theorem}[Heine-Borel Theorem]
    \label{heineborel}
    The closed interval $[a,b]$ is compact.
\end{theorem}

\begin{tcolorbox}
    \begin{proof}
        If $\mathscr{O}$ is an open cover of $[a,b]$, let
        $$A=\{x: a\le x\le b \text{ and $[a,x]$ is covered
        by some finite number of open sets in $\mathscr{O}$}\}.$$
        We know that $a \in A$ since we can choose any open
        set in $\mathscr{O}$ containing $a$. $A$ certainly 
        has a least upper bound since $A$
        is bounded above by $b$. So, we will
        show that if some $\alpha$ is the least upper bound
        of $A$, then $\alpha\in A$ and $\alpha=b$.$\\$

        Since $\alpha=\sup{A}$, for every $x\in A$,
        there exists an $\varepsilon$ such that
        $\alpha-x<\varepsilon$. Since $[a,x]$ is covered by
        some finite number of open sets, we can choose any
        open
        $\varepsilon$-neighborhood centered at $\alpha$.
        Hence, we see that $[a,\alpha]$ is also covered by
        finitely many open sets. This shows $\alpha \in A$.
        $\\$

        To show that $\alpha=b$, assume that $\alpha<b$.
        Since, we can find some $x'$ between $\alpha$ and
        $b$, such that $x'$ is contained in some open
        neighborhood around $\alpha$, we see that $[a,\alpha]$
        is covered by a single open set. Then certainly,
        $x'\in A$. But this contradicts that $\alpha=\sup{A}$.
        Hence, $\alpha=b$.
