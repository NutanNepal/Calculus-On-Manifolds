\begin{theorem}
    \label{topological continuity}
    If $A\subset \ron$, a function $f:A\to \rom$
    is continuous if and only if for every open
    set $U\subset\rom$ there is some open set
    $V\subset\ron$ such that $f^{-1}(U)=V\cap A$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{tcolorbox}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose $f$ is continuous. If $a\in
        f^{-1}(U)$, then $f(a)\in U$. Since
        $U$ is open, there is some open ball
        $B\subset U$ such that $f(a) \in B$.
        And since, $f$ is continuous at $a$,
        we know that $f(x)\in B$  provided we
        choose a sufficiently small open ball
        $C$ such that $a\in C$. If we do this
        for each $a \in f^{-1}(U)$ and call
        their union $V$ (also an open set),
        then clearly $f^{-1}(U)=V\cap A$.$\\$
